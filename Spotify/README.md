# Visualizing Personal Music from the Past Year Using Python and Tableau 
### Created a [dynamic dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/JaydensSpotifyHistory/JaydensSpotifyHistory?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to visualize my music trends over the past two years (April 2021-2023(There are a couple of weeks missing in April 2023)).
Inspiration for this project came from my love for music. I wanted to incorporate that into a data analysis/visualization project 
in order to get some practice, particularly in data visualization. This was a guided project where I used this awesome [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-spotify-data-with-python-tableau-687f2f528cdd) by Anne Bode.
## Interesting Points from the Project
* I listened to "Heated" by Beyonce the most.
* I have listened to the most music in May 2021 and March 2023.
* I listen to the most Spotify in the early afternoon, notably 1-2pm.
## Further Goals
* Continue to add on to the data every year and see longer trends.
* Help friends analyze their music.
* Further use and understand the Spotify API.
* Try and use the API to make a music recommendation app.
* Discover the error that is preventing loading genres
